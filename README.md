# Steam Higher or Lower Mini-Hackathon Project

## About the Hackathon

5 weeks into learning how to code, I participated in my first ever hackathon, which was a 24 hour challenge where we could build whatever we wanted to as long as it used an API. In reality, I had a lot less than 24 hours, which is why I am proud of what I managed to build. I am sure there are many ways that I could improve this project, especially as I keep learning, and so I plan to revisit this project one day and to improve it once I have learned even more.

## What is the game?

This is a simple quiz-like game where the player can test their knowledge of games on Steam! Using the Steam and the SteamSpy API, I obtain a list of the top 100 games and the live number of players playing each respective game. Upon loading the website, two random games are selected and displayed, one on the left and one on the right. The game on the left shows the number of current players, whereas the game on the right instead has two buttons: “More” or “Less”. The user makes their guess of whether the game on the right has more or less players than the game on the left, and if they are correct, then their score is increased and the game on the right shifts and moves to the left. A new random game then becomes the game on the right, and once again the user will make their guess. The game continues like this with the point being to get as many right in a row. My inspiration for this game was: http://www.higherlowergame.com/.
